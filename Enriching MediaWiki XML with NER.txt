to escape from them; in which pursuite the said french Captaine caused
7. peeces of Ordnance to be discharged with bullets att or against the
said shipp ''<ship>fortunes</ship>''. The premisses this deponent well knoweth being an
Eye witnesse of and acting therein.

To the third hee saith, That the said ffrenchmen of warr closely pursuing
the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and there being not any probability of her escape
from thence, or recovereing any Port of <place>fflanders</place>, shee steered her Course
towards the Coast of <place>England</place>, the Master and Company of her, (as this deponent
is fully convinced) hoping and intending to gett under the protection of some
shipp or shipps of warr in the service of this Commonwealth, during all which
fflight the said frenchmen of warr incessantly pursued and made after the
sayd shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and were readie to have Laid her aboard, and taken her
and her Ladeing. The premisses hee knoweth upon the grounds of knowledge
predeposed. And further cannot depose&amp;#58;-/

having spoken with the french Captaines, and understanding they were in

Lading to some of their enemies Ports in <place>fflanders</place> the said English
frigatt left them, the Officers thereof bidding them pursue their Prize
which they did, and shortly after another English friggat came up to
them, when the said frenchmen of warr were ready to have boarded and
taken the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and were but about a muskett shott
distance from her, but the said English frigatt discharging two
Gunns, the said frenchmen of warr in obediance to her lowred their
sailes, and attended her coming up, and the said friggatt being so come
up immediately sent men aboard the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and became
possessed of her and her ladeing, thereby depriveing and divesting the
french of the same. The premisses hee well knoweth, being an

the Coast of <place>ffrance</place> when first espyed and pursued by the said french
men of warr, had in all probability passed free and
undiscovered by the English, in case shee had not beene so chased, and
in the chase steered her Course towards the Coast of <place>England</place> aforesaid
the french coast being now the usuall course of shipps bound from <place>france</place>
to <place>fflanders</place> purposely to prevent seizure by the English, And so much hee
saith is well knowne to a Mariner useing and acquainted with that
Navigation.

To the 6th hee saith, That in Case the said English friggat had not, as
predeposed, come up and retarded the ffrench, and putt men aboard the
said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', the said frenchmen of warr had immediately
boarded and taken her and her lading it being impossible shee should
have escaped them being at the distance predeposed, and then &amp;#91;?retarded GUTTER&amp;#93;

also aboard him to the same effect, and were answered by the said

either of them able enough to have overpowred and taken the said

aboard her. and in regard of her lading being not in a capacity to
have entertained a fight with them or either of them, This hee well
knoweth being a person who hath for many yeares been used to the sea in
warlike imploying. And further saving his foregoing deposition hee
cannot depose./

To the 10th hee saith, That the said shipp the ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' her lading in
Controversy consisted principally in wynes and brandewine of
<place>Nantes</place>, but by whom or what Countriemen the same were there
Laden, or for whose particular accompt they went, hee knoweth not

|Transcription=Served and was aboard the said Shipp the ''<ship>Goulden Eagle</ship>''
during the discovery flight and pursuite predesposed

To the third Article hee saith, That there being noe visible probabilitie
that the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' should escape from the said two frenchmen of
warr, nor recover <place>Dunquirke</place> or any other Port of <place>fflanders</place>, (being so closely pursued) the
Master and Companie of the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' steered their Course towards
the Coast of <place>England</place>, intending, as this deponent in Conscience is most firmely
assured, to gett under the protection of some English shipp or shipps of
warr, the said frenchmen of warr still pursueing, and comeing neare to
the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' in a readinesse to have layd her aboarde and taken
her and her lading, The premisses hee declareth upon the grounds of
knowledge and conviction in Conscience aforesaid. And further
cannot depose./

To the 4th hee saith, That during the said pursuite and upon discharge of
severall gunns as predesposed, an English frigatt rideing at anchor neere
or in <place>Dover</place> roade weighed anchor and made up towards them; and the Officers thereof haveing
spoken both to the Captaines of the said frenchmen of warr, and to the
Master of the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, and being informed that the said shipp
''<ship>fortune</ship>'' was poursued by them in order to take her and her lading, as belonging
to the enemies of the Crowne of <place>ffrance</place> and bound for <place>fflanders</place> the said
frigat without any opposition departed and returned for the roade of
<place>Dover</place>, and another English frigat in the immediate service of this
Commonwealth comeing from the Westward of <place>England</place> and dischargeing <material>two
gunns</material>, the said frenchmen of warr in obeisance and respect to her
lowered their sailes just as they were within muskett shott or thereabouts
from the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, and readie to have boarded and taken her,
of which lowring their sayles the said English frigat takeing the oportunity
sent men aboard the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, who possessed themselves of her
and her lading, and brought them for <place>England</place> depriving the said
frenchmen of warr thereof. The premisses hee well knoweth
being present at the same in the condition predeposed./

To the 5th hee saith, That the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' according to the Course shee
shaped when first discovered as aforesaid, was undoubtedly bound for
<place>Dunquirke</place> or some other Port of <place>Spanish fflanders</place> shee then being neere
unto the Coast of <place>ffrance</place> which is the usuall Course of shipps bound
from <place>france</place> for <place>fflanders</place> doe take during hostility betweene <place>England</place> and
<place>Spaine</place>, thereby the better to escape the being discovered and seized by
the English, so that in all probability the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', if shee had
not bin pursued as aforesaid, had passed undiscovered by the English, and
had attained her desired port in <place>fflanders</place> The premisses hee declareth
upon the grounds before expressed, and for that being a seafareing person
and accustomed, to the coast aforesaid hee is to the coast aforesaid well versed in the <place>fflandrian</place> practizes in order to their
security in such cases. And further cannot depose./

To the 6th hee saith, That in case the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' and lading
had not bin boarded and taken as they were by the said English
friggatts Companie, the said two frenchmen of warr were in a
readinesse immediately to have boarded and taken them, they the
being at about a muskett shott distance from her, and, without any
ayd or assistance, were then sufficient to have overpowred and taken
(her

To the first hee saith hee cometh in the instance of the said <person>Thomas
Browning</person> to speake the truth in this cause, and that hee hath noe

To the second hee saith that as hee hath heard the said <person>Thomas
Browning</person> had an Adventure of his owne on board the said shipp
the said voyage, and this <person>deponent</person> holdeth the said allowance of
a <material>peece of eight</material> per day in the case aforesaid to be a duety from the
owners and not a gratuitie, in as much as a <occupation>master</occupation> or <occupation>purser</occupation> cannot
well be at lesse daily expense on
shoare; and hee doth not conceive that the owners having a factor
on shoare shall not excuse the said allowance, for a <occupation>master</occupation> is seldome
or never consigned to a port, where&amp;#91;?in&amp;#93; the owners have not some
factor or other person to give him assistance and that the <occupation>masters</occupation>
going ashoare to him and staying there and waiting on him about
the shipps business is for the most part equall expense to him as if there were noe
factor there, and that rate of a <material>peece of eight</material> per diem is a
mans ordinary expense there, and often more than lesse. And

To the 2&amp;#58; 3 and 4th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that the sayd shipp ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>''
in her returne from <place>Burdeaux</place> coming accompanyed with a vessell of <place>yarmouth</place>
whereof one <person>Appleby</person> was <occupation>Commander</occupation> was mett with by a <place>Brest</place> man of warr

the sayd other shipp whereof <person>Appleby</person> was <occupation>Commander</occupation> being a better sayler than

away called to this <person>deponent</person> and Company of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and sayd hee could doe
them noe good and that hee had rather they should bee taken than her, and bid
them shifte for them selves or to that effect and soe left the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'', which the
arlate <person>Thomkins</person> her <occupation>Pylott</occupation> perceiving advised this <person>deponent</person> and Company presently
to call out to the man of warr for quarter it being to noe purpose in his Judgment
(as hee sayd) to make resistance against a vessell soe well manned as the sayd
man of warr appeared to bee, there appearing upon her deck about <date>forty or fifty men</date>
and the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' having but <date>seaven men and a boy</date>, which notwithstanding hee
saith hee this <person>deponent</person> and Company of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' made divers shott against
the sayd man of warr intending if possible to have kept the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and her
ladeing from being taken but was over powered by the sayd man of warrs
numbers and not being able to defend their quarter from the sayd man
of warr seized the sayd shipp ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and her ladeing and saith at her sayd seizure
shee had one gunne laden but the gunnes standing upon Carriages in Portholes
and shee being a smale Pinke which could carrie noe gunns behinde could not
possibly defend her selfe against the forse of the sayd man of warr though
shee had at her seizure powder and shott sufficient though it were but a smale quantitie, in respect hee knoweth that be reason of the sayd man of warrs overpowering of her soe that hee well
knoweth shee was not lost for any want thereof, but meerely over powered with
multitude of men as aforesayd And further to these articles hee cannot depose/

vessell whereof the arlate <person>Appleby</person> was <occupation>Commander</occupation> who had in his sayd
shipp <material>three gunnes</material>, and saith the said <person>Appleby</person> perceiving that the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>''
and his shipp were chased or pursued by a man of warr, spake to
the <occupation>Master</occupation> and Company of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and told them that hee perceived
they were persued by a man of warr and that in likelyhood either
the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' or this shipp must bee taken, and therefore advised them
to looke to them selves for hee intended to leave them or to that effect, and thereupon
his the sayd <person>Applebyes</person> shipp being the better sayler hee went away
and left the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' to grapple with the sayd man of warr as well
as shee could, and hee being gone the sayd man of warr (which afterwards
appeared to bee a <place>Brest</place> man of warr) made up neerer to the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>''
and saith the arlate <person>Tompkins</person> seeing her drawe neere, advised the
<occupation>Master</occupation> of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' to call out for quarter and sayd it was to noe
purpose to resiste for that it appeared plainely (as indeed it did to

man of warr had <material>fower gunnes</material>, and <date>betweene forty and fifty men</date>

the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' being desyrous if possible to save his sayd shipp
and goods did make resistanse and caused his gunnes and severall musketts to be severall
tymes fyred against the man of warr, but this <person>deponent</person> and
others of the Company observing that the sayd man of warr
was come up close to the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and likely presently to enter
her quarter desyred the <occupation>Master</occupation> of her to call for quarter and withall
the Company threw downe their Musketts and lowered their Top saile,
which the <occupation>master</occupation> perceiving did aske quarter and soe the sayd shipp
''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' not being able to make further resistanse was taken
one of her gunnes being then laden, and some powder left, but
saith hee well knoweth the sayd shipp &amp;#123;and&amp;#125; goods was not lost through
any want of powder or <material>ammunition</material> but meerely by reason shee
was over powered with multitude of men who were ready
from the sayd man of warr to enter her quarter and shee being
a smale pinke which carried no gunnes behinde could not possibly
though her whole ladeing of had consisted of powder and shott have

and for Company did assent to go with them, and so stayed not at <place>Harwich</place>
but departed for <place>London</place> with the said <occupation>pilott</occupation> still on board, And it was in a <time>morning</time>
and the <ship>''<ship>Hare</ship>''</ship>, <ship>Ketch</ship> and <ship>hoy</ship> led the way and the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> followed them. And in
the <time>afternoon</time> of that day the said <ship>''<ship>hare Pinke</ship>''</ship>, <ship>ketch</ship> and <ship>hoy</ship> being still
on head of the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> came upon certain sands off of <place>Colchester</place>, And
the said vessels came also upon the said sands and fastened there, And her <occupation>master</occupation>

Company of the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> together with four of the <ship>''<ship>Hare</ship>''</ship>'s Company that had

upon the said sands before her <occupation>Master</occupation> and Company went ashore as aforesaid

To the 17th. and 18th articles he saith that the said ship came upon the said sands about <quantity>four leagues</quantity> from the shore, and there was no town near to the place, and only one
poor house whither the said four persons of the <ship>Pinke's</ship> Company and the <occupation>Master</occupation> and Com
pany of the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> came about <time>midnight</time>, and they enquired for help to get their
ship from the Sands but could hear of none, but within a day or two heard that
some fishermen had gotten the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> from the Sands and that she was gone for <place>London</place>
whither the said <person>Barnhide</person> this deponent and other his mates went to find her And
he saith That at the time of the said disaster upon the sands all the foresaid goods
laden as aforesaid at <place>Quinsburgh</place> were on board the said ship, and came after
wards to <place>London</place>, and there of this deponent's sight were all delivered to the
persons to who the same were consigned (the fore mentioned bundle of <commodity>hempe</commodity>

And further deposeth not.

To the xixth. Article he saith that all and singular the damages which
befell the said goods were caused by the fury and violence of the
foresaid <weather>stormes and tempests</weather>; and by the disaster upon the forementioned sands
and not by or through the neglect wilfulness or default whatsoever of the

To the first second and third Interrogatories This Rendent saith he kept no Journal of the
foresaid particulars, but well remembreth them as is easy to do after so short a time
it being but his last voyage. And saith he expecteth nothing whatsoever to come of

Examined upon the said allegation.

'''2'''

'''<person>Gabriel Smell</person>''' of <place>Lubeck</place> <occupation>Mariner</occupation> late <occupation>Steersman</occupation> of the said ship
the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> aged <quantity>thirty years</quantity> or thereabouts a witness sworn and
examined saith as followeth.

To the first and second Articles of the said allegation, This deponent saith, that about the time
arlate there were laden on board the said ship the <ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> at <place>Quinsburgh</place> arlate
<quantity>two and thirty bundles</quantity> of <commodity>hempe</commodity>, <quantity>one hundred</quantity> of <commodity>wainscott</commodity>, <quantity>one hundred</quantity>
of <commodity>pipe-boards</commodity>, <quantity>five hundred and one half</quantity> of <commodity>Clapboard</commodity>, <quantity>twelve hundred</quantity> and
an half <commodity>keeven staves</commodity>, <commodity>keepe pipe staves</commodity> and <quantity>three hundred</quantity> and
an half of <commodity>Oares</commodity>, all to be transported to <place>London</place> for several <occupation>English merchants</occupation>
at a freight agreed by their <occupation>Correspondents</occupation> or <occupation>factors</occupation>
at <place>Quinsbourgh</place>, The Premises he came to know being <occupation>Steersman</occupation> of the said
ship this voyage. And further he cannot depose.

To the 3rd. 4th and 5th Interrogatories he saith That the said ship the &#91;#&#93;

&#91;LH MARGIN&#93; &#91;#&#93; &#91;XXXXX was a strong
&#91;and well provided&#93;
&#91;GUTTER XXXXX cables
&#91;GUTTER XXXX and tackle
&#91;GUTTER XXXX XXXXX
&#91;GUTTER XXX And&#93;
&#91;GUTTER XX XXXX&#93; &#91;SIGNATURE, LH MARGIN&#93;

departed with her said lading
from the &#91;?Pilloa&#93; soon after the beginning of <date>September</date>, and met with excee=
ding bad weather and <weather>Crosse winds</weather> in the <place>East sea</place> which continued many days
and was often tempestuous so as in one <weather>storm</weather> the said ship took in much water lost her foresails
and was driven many leagues backward out of her Course, but came at last
to the <place>Sondt</place> of <place>denmarke</place> and there by reason of <weather>Crosse winds</weather> stayed about
<time>eight days</time>, And then departed from thence. which he knoweth being <occupation>Steersman</occupation>
man of the said ship as aforesaid.

To the 6. 7. and 8th. articles. he saith that within <time>two or three days</time> after the <ship>Hopes</ship>
departure from the <place>Sondt</place> aforesaid she met with a most fierce and violent <weather>storm</weather>
the wind blowing from about the <weather>Northwest point</weather>, wherein she was in exceeding
great danger of perishing with her lading. the winds being so high that she
could bear no sail but her main sail, which was let down very low. the
said storm he saith began in an <time>afternoon</time> and continued to the next day
and drew the said ship near the <place>Holmes</place> not far from <place>Jutland</place>, and there
the water being about <quantity>twelve fathom</quantity> two anchors were cast out but could not get
no fast hold so as the <occupation>Master</occupation> of the said ship <person>Martyn Barnhide</person> and Company
for preserving the said ship and her lading did necessarily resolve and did
cut down the mainmast which with the yards sails and tackle were by the
violence of the wind borne overboard and were lost in the sea, And the next
day after midday the wind changing and coming about the <weather>Southwest point</weather>
The said <person>Barnhide</person> and Company for preservation of the said ship and
her lading were constrained to cut one of their cables, and as they endeavored
to weigh up one of their anchors the same broke in pieces, so as both the said
Anchors were lost. only he saith a piece of one anchor was recovered. And
then the said ship set sail for the <place>Coast of Norway</place> and was at last through much
danger conducted by a <occupation>fisherman</occupation> (whom by chance she met with) into <place>Gusthaven</place>
arlate. And he moreover saith that by credible report which he then heard in
<place>Norway</place> many ships perished in the said storm, and so in all probability the
<ship>''<ship>Hope</ship>''</ship> and her lading had done if she had not been a very strong ship or in case
the <occupation>Master</occupation> and Company of her had not used their utmost industry to preserve her, which
he saith they did as far as was possible for men to do. And saith also that
the said mast was cut and said sails yards ropes and tackle lost, and the said anchor
and half and half cable likewise for preserving of the said ship and lading.
the value of which things so lost he conceiveth to be about <quantity>four hundred and
thirty dollars</quantity>, and also believeth that the goods being so preserved ought to contribute
towards the said loss. And otherwise he cannot depose saving that in the said
storm the said ship received great quantities of water into her.

|Transcription=To the 9. 10. and 11th. articles he saith That the sayd <ship>shipp</ship> having suffered so much
in the sayd <weather>storme</weather> was of necessity to be fitted with what she lacked before shee
could proceed on her voyage for <place>London</place>, To which purpose the sayd <person>Barnhide</person>
(<place>Gusthaven</place> not affording such things) did goe to <place>Christian=Sandt</place> in <place>Norway</place>
and there provided a new mast which was fitted and sett upp, on board
the <ship>''Hope''</ship>, and also two anchors and some sayles and Cordage such as that place
afforded. And he borrowed seventy <quantity>Rijx dollars</quantity> of his shipps Company
towards the paying for the sayd things; and had also some moneyes from one
<person>&amp;#91;?Peninck&amp;#93;</person> (but how much he knoweth not). and also sold a bundle of <commodity>hempe</commodity>
for the same purpose, but for how much he knoweth not. neyther knoweth he
what the sayd things cost. And he saith that for the fitting of the sayd shipp
<time>seaven weekes</time> were spent, and then she departed for <place>London</place> but was
forced by <weather>Crosse winds</weather> into <place>Flackery</place> as is allegat and there stayed
about <time>eight dayes</time>, and then coming for <place>England</place> and this <place>Port</place>
of <place>London</place>, the winds at length not favouring, did putt into <place>Newcastle</place>
about the beginning of <date>december last</date>. All which he knoweth being
of her Company as aforesayd. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 12. 13. 14. and 15th articles he saith that the <ship>''Hope''</ship> stayed at <place>Newcastle</place> about
<time>four dayes</time> in which time the sayd <person>Barnhide</person> hired one <person>Holland</person> a pilot there
to bring the sayd shipp to <place>London</place>, which the sayd <person>Holland</person> undertooke to doe
and did after about <time>eight dayes</time> bring her and her lading to <place>Harwich</place>
whither she came in a morning and stayd not there for that there was
the <ship>''Hare pinke''</ship> being an <nationality>English</nationality> man of warr and a <ship>Ketch</ship>, and an <ship>hoy</ship>
then departing for <place>London</place>, and the Captaine of the sayd <ship>Pinke</ship> promising to
Convoy the <ship>''Hope''</ship> to her Port, the sayd <ship>Pinke</ship>, <ship>ketch</ship>, and <ship>hoy</ship> sett sayle and
lead the way, and the <ship>''Hope''</ship> followed them having her foresayd Pilott
still on board her, And in the afternoone of the same day the sayd vessells
sayling as aforesayd came upon the Sands arlate. and the <ship>Pinke</ship> and <ship>''Hope''</ship>
stuck fast. And the sayd <ship>Pinke</ship> within a small time was beaten in peices
and perished, and the <ship>''Hope''</ship> stuck so fast that though all possible meanes
were used she could not be gott off. thereupon the Company of the <ship>Pinke</ship>
being about <quantity>thirty persons</quantity> not being able to gett all safe a shoare in their
owne boat which was but small did endeavour to gett the <ship>''Hopes''</ship> boat which
the sayd <person>Barnhide</person> and Company would not part with, but, desiring to stay by
their ship to loose her if possible, kept their boat to save their owne
lives if the case should come to extremity. Of the premisses he was an eye=
witnes and otherwise cannot depose.

To the 16. and 17th. articles he saith That at length four of the <ship>''Hare pinkes''</ship>
Company got into the <ship>''Hopes''</ship> boat, and acquainted the sayd <person>Barnhide</person> of the danger that
might befall him if the rest of the <ship>''Hares''</ship> Company should take his boat from
him, saying that they did intend so to doe, whereupon the sayd <person>Barnhide</person> and
his Company finding their endeavours to gett their shipp off the Sands to be
fruitless, and being sollicited by the sayd four persons as aforesayd did with
them goe to shoare in their sayd boat. And the sayd shipp <ship>''Hope''</ship> before her
Master and Company so left her had received much water in her hold, the
Premisses he knoweth being then present aboard her. And otherwise he cannot
depose, saving that the sayd disasters happened about <quantity>three leagues</quantity>
from shoare, and that it was <time>midnight</time> before the <ship>''Hopes''</ship> boat with the people
in her came to shoare, and saving that there was noe towne there and but
one little howse, and that noe help could be heard of to gett off the sayd
shipp from the Sands, and that afterwards there was newes that some ffishermen
had gotten her loose and were carrying her for <place>London</place> whereupon the sayd
<person>Barnhide</person> and Company came up to this Port.

<place>Port</place> to the parties to whom they were consigned, this deponent being present at

which happened to the sayd goods did come and happen to the same by reason of
the sayd severall storms aforesayd, and by reason of the disaster of the
sayd shipps coming upon the sayd sands, And the master and Company of
the sayd shipp did during the whole voyage doe their best endeavour
in their respective duties, and that no damage at all befell the sayd
goods or any of them by the fault or neglect of the sayd master and Company

delivered at the Port of their discharge And further to this article he cannot

and <person>George Nutt</person>, was brought safe to their said shipps side (though they had
broke loose (as they said) once or twice by the way) and that after they had taken
up one butt of the said wine and had the same within the tack of the said
shipp the remainder of the said raft of wine (being <quantity>twenty nine butts</quantity>) were
sunk in the sea by the said shipps side And further to this article he cannot depose/
