meane time using all possible diligence, and making all the sayle they could
to escape from them; in which pursuite the said french Captaine caused
7. peeces of Ordnance to be discharged with bullets att or against the
said shipp ''<ship>fortunes</ship>''. The premisses this deponent well knoweth being an
Eye witnesse of and acting therein.

To the third hee saith, That the said ffrenchmen of warr closely pursuing
the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and there being not any probability of her escape
from thence, or recovereing any Port of <place>fflanders</place>, shee steered her Course
towards the Coast of <place>England</place>, the Master and Company of her, (as this deponent
is fully convinced) hoping and intending to gett under the protection of some
shipp or shipps of warr in the service of this Commonwealth, during all which
fflight the said frenchmen of warr incessantly pursued and made after the
sayd shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and were readie to have Laid her aboard, and taken her
and her Ladeing. The premisses hee knoweth upon the grounds of knowledge
predeposed. And further cannot depose&amp;#58;-/

To the 4th article hee saith, That during the said fligght, pursuite and
discharge of Ordnance by the said frenchmen of warr against the said
shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and English frigatt in the immediate service of this
Commonwealth rideing at an anchor neere <place>dover</place>, weighed anchor
and came up with them&amp;#58; and the Officers of the said English man of warr
having spoken with the french Captaines, and understanding they were in
pursuite of the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' as being a Shipp bound with her
Lading to some of their enemies Ports in <place>fflanders</place> the said English
frigatt left them, the Officers thereof bidding them pursue their Prize
which they did, and shortly after another English friggat came up to
them, when the said frenchmen of warr were ready to have boarded and
taken the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and were but about a muskett shott
distance from her, but the said English frigatt discharging two
Gunns, the said frenchmen of warr in obediance to her lowred their
sailes, and attended her coming up, and the said friggatt being so come
up immediately sent men aboard the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', and became
possessed of her and her ladeing, thereby depriveing and divesting the
french of the same. The premisses hee well knoweth, being an
Eyewittnesse thereof&amp;#58;-

To the 5th article hee saith, That the aid shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' passing so close to
the Coast of <place>ffrance</place> when first espyed and pursued by the said french
men of warr, had in all probability passed free and
undiscovered by the English, in case shee had not beene so chased, and
in the chase steered her Course towards the Coast of <place>England</place> aforesaid
the french coast being now the usuall course of shipps bound from <place>france</place>
to <place>fflanders</place> purposely to prevent seizure by the English, And so much hee
saith is well knowne to a Mariner useing and acquainted with that
Navigation.

To the 6th hee saith, That in Case the said English friggat had not, as
predeposed, come up and retarded the ffrench, and putt men aboard the
said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', the said frenchmen of warr had immediately
boarded and taken her and her lading it being impossible shee should
have escaped them being at the distance predeposed, and then &amp;#91;?retarded GUTTER&amp;#93;

either of them able enough to have overpowred and taken the said

Laden, or for whose particular accompt they went, hee knoweth not

during the discovery flight and pursuite predesposed

To the third Article he

e saith, That there being noe visible probabilitie
that the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' should escape from the said two frenchmen of
warr, nor recover <place>Dunquirke</place> or any other Port of <place>fflanders</place>, (being so closely pursued) the
Master and Companie of the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' steered their Course towards
the Coast of <place>England</place>, intending, as this deponent in Conscience is most firmely
assured, to gett under the protection of some English shipp or shipps of
warr, the said frenchmen of warr still pursueing, and comeing neare to
the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' in a readinesse to have layd her aboarde and taken
her and her lading, The premisses hee declareth upon the grounds of
knowledge and conviction in Conscience aforesaid. And further
cannot depose./

To the 4th hee saith, That during the said pursuite and upon discharge of
severall gunns as predesposed, an English frigatt rideing at anchor neere
or in <place>Dover</place> roade weighed anchor and made up towards them; and the Officers thereof haveing
spoken both to the Captaines of the said frenchmen of warr, and to the
Master of the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, and being informed that the said shipp
''<ship>fortune</ship>'' was poursued by them in order to take her and her lading, as belonging
to the enemies of the Crowne of <place>ffrance</place> and bound for <place>fflanders</place> the said
frigat without any opposition departed and returned for the roade of
<place>Dover</place>, and another English frigat in the immediate service of this
Commonwealth comeing from the Westward of <place>England</place> and dischargeing <material>two
gunns</material>, the said frenchmen of warr in obeisance and respect to her
lowered their sailes just as they were within muskett shott or thereabouts
from the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, and readie to have boarded and taken her,
of which lowring their sayles the said English frigat takeing the oportunity
sent men aboard the said shipp <ship>fortune</ship>, who possessed themselves of her
and her lading, and brought them for <place>England</place> depriving the said
frenchmen of warr thereof. The premisses hee well knoweth
being present at the same in the condition predeposed./

To the 5th hee saith, That the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' according to the Course shee
shaped when first discovered as aforesaid, was undoubtedly bound for
<place>Dunquirke</place> or some other Port of <place>Spanish fflanders</place> shee then being neere
unto the Coast of <place>ffrance</place> which is the usuall Course of shipps bound
from <place>france</place> for <place>fflanders</place> doe take during hostility betweene <place>England</place> and
<place>Spaine</place>, thereby the better to escape the being discovered and seized by
the English, so that in all probability the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'', if shee had
not bin pursued as aforesaid, had passed undiscovered by the English, and
had attained her desired port in <place>fflanders</place> The premisses hee declareth
upon the grounds before expressed, and for that being a seafareing person
and accustomed, to the coast aforesaid hee is to the coast aforesaid well versed in the <place>fflandrian</place> practizes in order to their
security in such cases. And further cannot depose./

To the 6th hee saith, That in case the said shipp ''<ship>fortune</ship>'' and lading
had not bin boarded and taken as they were by the said English
friggatts Companie, the said two frenchmen of warr were in a
readinesse immediately to have boarded and taken them, they the
being at about a muskett shott distance from her, and, without any
ayd or assistance, were then sufficient to have overpowred and taken

To the 2&amp;#58; 3 and 4th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith that the sayd shipp ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>''
in her returne from <place>Burdeaux</place> coming accompanyed with a vessell of <place>yarmouth</place>

the sayd other shipp whereof <person>Appleby</person> was <occupation>Commander</occupation> being a better sayler than

arlate <person>Thomkins</person> her <occupation>Pylott</occupation> perceiving advised this <person>deponent</person> and Company presently
to call out to the man of warr for quarter it being to noe purpose in his Judgment
(as hee sayd) to make resistance against a vessell soe well manned as the sayd
man of warr appeared to bee, there appearing upon her deck about <date>forty or fifty men</date>
and the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' having but <date>seaven men and a boy</date>, which notwithstanding hee

numbers and not being able to defend their quarter from the sayd man
of warr seized the sayd shipp ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and her ladeing and saith at her sayd seizure
shee had one gunne laden but the gunnes standing upon Carriages in Portholes
and shee being a smale Pinke which could carrie noe gunns behinde could not

was a proportionable quantitie as hee beleeveth to the sayd gunnes musketts and

vessell whereof the arlate <person>Appleby</person> was <occupation>Commander</occupation> who had in his sayd

and his shipp were chased or pursued by a man of warr, spake to
the <occupation>Master</occupation> and Company of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and told them that hee perceived
they were persued by a man of warr and that in likelyhood either
the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' or this shipp must bee taken, and therefore advised them
to looke to them selves for hee intended to leave them or to that effect, and thereupon
his the sayd <person>Applebyes</person> shipp being the better sayler hee went away
and left the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' to grapple with the sayd man of warr as well
as shee could, and hee being gone the sayd man of warr (which afterwards
appeared to bee a <place>Brest</place> man of warr) made up neerer to the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>''
and saith the arlate <person>Tompkins</person> seeing her drawe neere, advised the
<occupation>Master</occupation> of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' to call out for quarter and sayd it was to noe
purpose to resiste for that it appeared plainely (as indeed it did to
this <person>deponent</person> and the <occupation>Master</occupation> and Company of the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'') that the sayd
man of warr had <material>fower gunnes</material>, and <date>betweene forty and fifty men</date>

<date>sixe or seaven men and a boy</date>, which notwithstanding the <occupation>Master</occupation> of
the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' being desyrous if possible to save his sayd shipp
and goods did make resistanse and caused his gunnes and severall musketts to be severall
tymes fyred against the man of warr, but this <person>deponent</person> and
others of the Company observing that the sayd man of warr
was come up close to the ''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' and likely presently to enter
her quarter desyred the <occupation>Master</occupation> of her to call for quarter and withall
the Company threw downe their Musketts and lowered their Top saile,
which the <occupation>master</occupation> perceiving did aske quarter and soe the sayd shipp
''<ship>Prosperous</ship>'' not being able to make further resistanse was taken
one of her gunnes being then laden, and some powder left, but
saith hee well knoweth the sayd shipp &amp;#123;and&amp;#125; goods was not lost through
any want of powder or <material>ammunition</material> but meerely by reason shee
was over powered with multitude of men who were ready
from the sayd man of warr to enter her quarter and shee being
a smale pinke which carried no gunnes behinde could not possibly
though her whole ladeing of had consisted of powder and shott have
made any resistanse more than shee did, And further to theise
articles hee cannot depose./
